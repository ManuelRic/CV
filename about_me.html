                My name is Manuel Ricart, originally from Valencia, Spain. I study Technology and Multimedia at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV), and I am currently doing my ERASMUS for one semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I am actively searching for an internship, ideally outside of Spain.

                I am passionate about full-stack development, software development, videogame creation (including VR), 3D design, and CAD. I love working on anything with a creative edge, and enjoy integrating my different skills to create unique and elevated projects. I pay close attention to details in both development and design, especially in user experience, because I believe the little things make the difference between a good project and a great one.

                I studied for 10 years in Panama, starting at the age of 7 at the Metropolitan School of Panama (MET), where I began the IB program. Later, I moved back to Spain to finish my IB program at SEK Levante and pursue my university studies.

                Outside of academics, I love outdoor activities and enjoy trying new experiences. I’m into rock climbing, kayaking, and spent several years playing rugby, where I served as captain since the club’s earliest days. I’ve been drawn to art since I was young — starting with hands-on styles and later exploring digital creation. This curiosity for creativity, combined with my interest in technology, led me to pursue a degree that bridges both worlds.
