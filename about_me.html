            My name is Manuel Ricart, originally from Valencia, Spain. I study Technology and Multimedia at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV), and I am currently doing my ERASMUS for one semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I am actively searching for an internship, ideally outside of Spain.

            I am passionate about full-stack development, software development, videogame creation (including VR), 3D design, and CAD. I love working on anything with a creative edge, and enjoy integrating my different skills to create unique and elevated projects. I pay close attention to details in both development and design, especially in user experience, because I believe the little things make the difference between a good project and a great one.

            I studied for 10 years in Panama, starting at the age of 7 at the Metropolitan School of Panama (MET), where I began the IB program. Later, I moved back to Spain to finish my IB program and pursue my university studies.

            Outside of academics, I love outdoor activities and always enjoy trying new experiences. I enjoy rock climbing, kayaking, and all the classics. I have been passionate about art since I was young,starting with hands-on styles and later discovering digital art. This passion for creativity, combined with my love for technology, inspired me to choose my degree, allowing me to explore the potential of mixing both worlds.
